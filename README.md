# IGPV
## Interactive Genetic Programming Visualizer

## What is this
This repository contains a simple demo notebook to generate, visualize, and save images created using Genetic Programming.

## How to use it
Just run the notebook in Google Colaboratory.

## Roadmap
The notebook is pretty simple as-is, and requires saving/loading specific GP trees (or entire populations), a way to let the user mutate/crossover solutions, and a more straightforward way of saving images in the desired resolution.
